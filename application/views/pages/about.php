				<h1>About Laravel</h1>

				<p>
					Laravel is a PHP framework committed to elegance and simplicity. Programming doesn't have to be painful.

					Hi. I'm Taylor Otwell and I created Laravel in April of 2011. I love building tools that make development enjoyable,
					and that's why I created Laravel. After exploring and enjoying frameworks, I needed something that was up-to-date with
					the latest PHP 5.3 has to offer while maintaining a low barrier of entry through great documentation. Sadly, I didn't
					find what I was looking for. So, I began writing a framework that was powerful and flexible, yet intuitive and expressive.
					A few months later, Laravel was born, and its had a growing and friendly community ever since. I think you'll love joining the club.

					Currently, I'm Software Engineer at <a href="http://userscape.com">UserScape</a>, where I work on the next generation of
					<a href="http://helpspot.com">HelpSpot</a>. Previously, I developed Microsoft .NET solutions for one of the largest freight
					carriers in the nation.
